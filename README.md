# Bank Clients Clustering

## Overview
This project involves creating an unsupervised machine learning clustering model to group bank customers based on various features and studying each cluster.

**Note:**
This project is a continuation of the project on the classification of clients (where the EDA analysis was already done)

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Google Collaboratory

## Libraries Used
### Data Pre-Processing and Analysis

## Project Steps
1. Data Import
2. Handling missing values (Remove, fill NaN values)
3. Features Selection
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Scaling(Standartization)
6. Feature Encoding
7. Dimensionality reduction - UMAP
8. selecting the number of clusters
